	This method will initalise the Population by
		1. Placing clusters that the user would like in the initial population
		2. Generate a number of extra clusters so that the population has the desired number of clusters in it.

	This method is used when the population is first created when the genetic algorithm is just starting, and when an epoch method is resetting the population with a new population of randomly generated clusters.

	:param population: The population
	:type  population: Organisms.GA.Population
	:param cluster_makeup: The makeup of the cluster
	:type  cluster_makeup: dict.
	:param surface: This is the surface that the cluster is placed on. None means there is no surface.
	:type  surface: Organisms.GA.Surface
	:param Minimisation_Function: The minimisation function
	:type  Minimisation_Function: __func__	
	:param memory_operator: The memory operator
	:type  memory_operator: Organisms.GA.Memory_Operator
	:param epoch: The epoch method
	:type  epoch: Organisms.GA.Epoch	
	:param predation_operator: This is the predation operator 
	:type  predation_operator: Organisms.GA.Predation_Operator
	:param fitness_operator: This is the fitness operator
	:type  fitness_operator: Organisms.GA.Fitness_Operator
	:param cell_length: This is the length of the square unit cell the cluster will be created in.
	:type  cell_length: float
	:param vacuum_to_add_length: The amount of vacuum to place around the cluster
	:type  vacuum_to_add_length: float
	:param r_ij: The maximum distance that should be between atoms to be considered bonded. This value should be as large a possible, to reflected the longest bond possible between atoms in the cluster.
	:type  r_ij: float
	:param rounding_criteria: The number of decimal places to round the energy of clusters to.
	:type  rounding_criteria: int
	:param no_of_cpus: The number of cpus available to create clusters 
	:type  no_of_cpus: int
	:param previous_cluster_name: This is the name of the last cluster created in the genetic algorithm.  Default: 0
	:type  previous_cluster_name: int
	:param generation: The number of generations that have been performed. Default: 0
	:type  generation: int
	:param get_already_created_clusters: Are there clusters that the user created in the population. True if yes, False if no. Default: True
	:type  get_already_created_clusters: bool.
	:param is_epoch: Has the genetic algorithm just epoched. Default: False
	:type  is_epoch: bool.
	:param epoch_due_to_population_energy_convergence: Did the genetic algorithm epochbecause the energies of the clusters in the last populatino converge. Default: None
	:type  epoch_due_to_population_energy_convergence: bool.

	:returns previous_cluster_name: This is the name of the last cluster created by this method
