Examples of Running the Organisms Program with *Run.py*
=======================================================

Provided in the Organisms Github repository are examples of *Run.py* (and *RunMinimisation.py*, see :ref:`RunMinimisation.py - Writing a Local Minimisation Function for the Genetic Algorithm <Local_Minimisation_Function>` for more information about this file) scripts that you can try out. Find these various examples at https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/Organisms/tree/main/Examples. 

We have also developed a Jupyter notebook with some examples of various *Run.py* (and *RunMinimisation.py*) that you can play with and muck around with. The Github repository for this Jupyter notebook can be found at https://github.com/GardenGroupUO/Organisms_Jupyter_Examples. 

Along with this Jupyter notebook, we have also implemented this Jupyter notebook into Binder. Binder (https://mybinder.org/) is an interactive online platform that allows you to use Jupyter notebooks on an web browser without having to set up anything. It does all the setting up on a virtual computer for you. If you want to play around with the Organisms program before you download it on your computer or if you need help when things go wrong using Organisms on your computer, Binder+Jupyter is the best way to do this. **It is recommended that you try out the Organisms program on Binder if you are interested or intending on using the Organisms program**.

The Binder webpage can be found at: 

https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GardenGroupUO/Organisms_Jupyter_Examples/main?filepath=Notebooks%2FOrganisms_Jupyter_Example.ipynb. 

This will load a Binder page that will allow you to play about with the Organisms program interactively in Binder. This will take about 1 to 2 minutes to load. Don't refresh the page as Binder takes a good amount of time to load. Get a coffee or a cup of tea while you wait. Once this is done you will see a Jupyter notebook that you can interact with. Mess around with it as much as you want!
